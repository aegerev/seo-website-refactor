## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The webpage displays a picture and a banner with the logo and the weblinks to different sections. By clicking on those weblinks, the user can "jump" to different sections of the web page.

ABOUT THE LOGO: With the updated logo colors (before, it was all white and gray; now, it's yellow and blue), this website - and this repository - and I - support Ukraine every step of the way. 

We wish this war never happened, but whatever it takes, we will support Ukraine to the end.
